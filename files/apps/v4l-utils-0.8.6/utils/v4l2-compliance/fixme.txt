This file keeps track of ambiguities and just plain problems found in the
V4L2 specification while writing and testing this compliance test tool.

At some point in time these issues should be resolved, but by placing them
here they won't be forgotten.

- Should QUERYCAP report capabilities for only the current device node or
  'system wide'?

- Are tuner audio modes other than MONO and STEREO allowed for FM receivers?

- If I set a tuner audio mode to something that is not supported by the hardware,
  should the driver return an error, or silently modify the audio mode, or just
  accept it?

- G/S_FREQUENCY: this can be used for both receivers and modulators, but if a
  device has both, then how to I tell the driver that this is the frequency for
  the modulator instead of the tuner?

- Related question: how do I tell whether a modulator is for TV or FM radio?

- Control documentation is out of date regarding use of class_ctrl 0 and how
  error_idx should be set for G/S_EXT_CTRLS and for TRY_EXT_CTRLS (which does
  this slightly differently).

- V4L2_FBUF_CAP_SRC_CHROMAKEY: I believe this is defined the wrong way around in
  DocBook.

- define properly V4L2_FBUF_FLAG_PRIMARY and V4L2_FBUF_FLAG_OVERLAY.
- ditto V4L2_FBUF_CAP_EXTERNOVERLAY: do bytesperline, sizeimage and base need to be
  set or not? Determine for overlay and output overlay.
