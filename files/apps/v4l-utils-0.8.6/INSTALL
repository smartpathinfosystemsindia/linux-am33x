Requirements:
-------------
* make and a c and c++ compiler
* optionally qt3 ot qt4 for building qv4l2
* optionally libsysfs for building v4l2-sysfs-path


Building:
---------

Before building decide under which PREFIX you wish to install
(the default is /usr/local), and if you want the libraries to be installed
under a different directory then $PREFIX/lib for example $PREFIX/lib64.

To build execute "make" specifying the desired installation prefix
and (optionally) the desired libdir, for example:
make PREFIX=/usr LIBDIR=/usr/lib64


Installing:
-----------

To install do "make install", and again specify the desired PREFIX and
LIBDIR, note that it is important to specify the same PREFIX and LIBDIR
as used when building, for example:
make install PREFIX=/usr LIBDIR=/usr/lib64

Note that v4l-utils' "make install" supports DESTDIR for installing into
a build root for example:
make install PREFIX=/usr LIBDIR=/usr/lib64 DESTDIR=/mnt/sysimage
