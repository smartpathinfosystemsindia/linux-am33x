* Add error checking to mr97310a decompression
* Increase mr97310a minimum clockdiv upon 3 consecutive decoding errors
* Add support for decompressing CPIA1 compressed YUV
* Speed up autogain algorithm

libv4l-0.6.3

* Bugfix: fixup 320x240 output for pac7302 cameras
* README improvements / clarifications (Bifferos)
* Bugfix: fix reqbuf Device or Resource busy error when using v4l2_read()
* Some applications want to use jpg format if possible, so do not hide
  it from the apps (do not assume it always needs conversion)
* Change controls shm segment name to include the username, as it is only
  writable by the user (this means libv4l controls are per user) (Gregor Jasny)
* Add support for decompressing sn9c2028 compressed bayer (Theodore Kilgore)
* Report V4L2_FMT_FLAG_EMULATED in v4l2_fmtdesc flags for emulated formats

libv4l-0.6.0

* Recognize disabled controls and replace with fake equivalents where
  available
* Add support for decompressing ov511 and ov518 "JPEG", by piping data through
  an external helper as I've failed to contact Mark W. McClelland to get
  permission to relicense the code. If you know a working email address for
  Mark W. McClelland, please let me know.
* Add tons of laptop models to the upside down devices table
* Support for rgb565 source format by Mauro Carvalho Chehab
* Many bug fixes (see the mercurial tree for details)
* Improved pac207 decompression code to also support higher compression
  modes of the pac207, which enables us to use higher framerates.
  Many many thanks to Bertrik Sikken for figuring the decompression out!

libv4l-0.5.99
-------------
* Link libv4lconvert with -lm for powf by Gregor Jasny
* Fix black screen on devices with hardware gamma control
* Fix crash with devices on which we do not emulate fake controls
* Add a patch by Hans Petter Selasky <hselasky@freebsd.org>, which should
  lead to allowing use of libv4l (and the Linux webcam drivers ported
  to userspace usb drivers) on FreeBSD, this is a work in progress

libv4l-0.5.98
-------------
* Add software gamma correction
* Add software auto gain / exposure
* Add support for separate vflipping and hflipping
* Add fake controls controlling the software h- and v-flipping
* Add ability to determine upside down cams based on DMI info
* Add the capability to provide 320x240 to apps if the cam can only
  do 320x232 (some zc3xx cams) by adding black borders
* Rewrite video processing code to make it easier to add more video filters
  (and with little extra processing cost). As part of this the normalize
  filter has been removed as it wasn't functioning satisfactory anyways
* Support V4L2_CTRL_FLAG_NEXT_CTRL for fake controls by Adam Baker
* Some makefile improvements by Gregor Jasny
* Various small bugfixes and tweaks
* The V4L2_ENABLE_ENUM_FMT_EMULATION v4l2_fd_open flag is obsolete, libv4l2
  now *always* reports emulated formats through the ENUM_FMT ioctl

libv4l-0.5.97
-------------
* As the version number shows this is a beta release of the 0.6.x series,
  the big change here is the addition of video processing to libv4l
  currently this only does whitebalance and normalizing (which turns out
  to be useless for most cams) but the basic framework for doing video
  processing, and being able to control it through fake v4l2 controls using
  for example v4l2ucp is there.
  The initial version of this code was written by 3 of my computer science
  students: Elmar Kleijn, Sjoerd Piepenbrink and Radjnies Bhansingh
* Currently whitebalancing gets enabled based on USB-ID's and it only gets
  enabled for Pixart webcam's. You can force it being enabled with other
  webcams by setting the environment variable LIBV4LCONTROL_CONTROLS, this
  sets a bitmask enabling certain v4l2 controls which control the video
  processing set it to 15 to enable both whitebalancing and normalize. You
  can then change the settings using a v4l2 control panel like v4l2ucp
* Only report / allow supported destination formats in enum_fmt / try_fmt /
  g_fmt / s_fmt when processing, rotating or flipping.
* Some applications / libs (*cough* gstreamer *cough*) will not work
  correctly with planar YUV formats when the width is not a multiple of 8,
  so crop widths which are not a multiple of 8 to the nearest multiple of 8
  when converting to planar YUV
* Add dependency generation to libv4l by: Gilles Gigan <gilles.gigan@gmail.com>
* Add support to use orientation from VIDIOC_ENUMINPUT by:
  Adam Baker <linux@baker-net.org.uk>
* sn9c20x cams have occasional bad jpeg frames, drop these to avoid the
  flickering effect they cause, by: Brian Johnson <brijohn@gmail.com>
* adjust libv4l's upside down cam detection to also work with devices
  which have the usb interface as parent instead of the usb device
* fix libv4l upside down detection for the new v4l minor numbering scheme
* fix reading outside of the source memory when doing yuv420->rgb conversion

libv4l-0.5.9
------------
* Add support for MR97310A decompression by Kyle Guinn <elyk03@gmail.com>
* Add support for sq905c decompression by Theodore Kilgore
  <kilgota@auburn.edu>
* Add hm12 support for the cx2341x MPEG encoder devices by Hans Verkuil
  <hverkuil@xs4all.nl>

libv4l-0.5.8
------------
* Add support for UYVY (for USB Apple iSight) patch by Julien BLACHE
  <jb@jblache.org>
* Remove v4lconvert_yvyu_to_yuv420 function as its functionality is
  duplicate with v4lconvert_yuyv_to_yuv420
* Use Requires.private where appropiate in .pc files (patch by Gregor Jasny)
* Switch to using USB-id's instead of USB product string, as not all devices
  set a unique product string. This fixes the upside down issues with
  genius e-messenger 112 cams
* Add support for sn9c20x-i420 format patch by Vasily Khoruzhick
  <anarsoul@gmail.com>

libv4l-0.5.7
------------
* Fix a nasty (and stupid) bug in the special try_fmt handling for UVC cams
* Add some more verbose logging of various calls when asking libv4l to log
  calls to a file, to assist in (future) debugging

libv4l-0.5.6
------------
* Always do a s_fmt on uvc cams even if this changes nothing, as not doing
  the s_fmt triggers a bug in the uvcvideo driver in kernel <= 2.6.28
  (with certain cams)

libv4l-0.5.5
------------
* Avoid the use of try_fmt as much as possible on UVC cams, instead use the
  results of the enum_framesizes ioctl. This is because:
  1) try_fmt actually causes IO with UVC cams making apps which do lot of
     querrying of device capabilities slow (cheese)
  2) some buggy cams don't like getting lots of UVC video probes and crash
     when they do

libv4l-0.5.4
------------
* Don't report DQBUF errors when errno is EAGAIN, this fixes flooding the
  screen with errors when applications use non blocking mode
* Add support for downscaling to make apps which want low resolutions
  (skype, spcaview) happy when used with cams which can only do high
  resolutions (by Lukáš Karas <lukas.karas@centrum.cz>).
* Add support for converting to YV12 planar (next to the already supported
  YU12 / I420)
* Implement RGB/BGR24 -> YU/YV12 conversion

libv4l-0.5.3
------------
* When conversion requires multiple passes don't alloc the needed temporary
  buffer on the stack, as some apps (ekiga) use so much stack themselves
  this causes us to run out of stack space

libv4l-0.5.2
------------
* Add Philips SPC210NC to list of cams with upside down sensor, reported by
  Rieker Flaik
* Work around some drivers (pwc) not properly reflecting what one gets after a
  s_fmt in their try_fmt answer
* Check that s_fmt atleast gives us the width, height and pixelformat try_fmt
  promised us, and if not disable conversion
* Only check width, height and pixelformat when checking if we are doing
  conversion, instead of doing a memcmp, as that are the only things which
  the convert code checks
* Take into account that the buffers only contain half of the lines when
  field is V4L2_FIELD_ALTERNATE

libv4l-0.5.1
------------
* Add support for software cropping from 352x288 -> 320x240 / 176x144 ->
  160x120, so that apps which will only work with vga resolutions like
  320x240 (Skype!) will work with cams/drivers which do not support cropping
  CIF resolutions to VGA resolutions in hardware. This makes all 2.6.27 gspca
  supported cams, except for the pac7302 which only does 640x480 (and skype
  wants 320x240), work with skype
* The v4lconvert_convert function was becoming a bit of a mess, so split the
  functionailiy into separate v4lconvert_convert_pixfmt, v4lconvert_rotate and
  v4lconvert_crop functions, and make v4lconvert_convert a frontend to
  these
* Do not link the wrapper libs against libpthread (patch from Gregor Jasny)

libv4l-0.5.0
------------
* Add support for enumerating framesizes and frameintervals of emulated
  formats when the driver supports it for the real format
* Make sure the video device always gets opened RW even if the application
  asks for RO
* Add Genius E-Messenger 112 (093a:2476) to list of cams which have their
  sensor upside down

libv4l-0.4.3
------------
* Add suport for YUYV and YVYU packed pixel formats (Jean-Francois Moine)
* Prefer compressed pixformats for resolutions > 176x144

libv4l-0.4.2
------------
* The bayer pixel order in gspca's sonixb driver was different from that in
  the sn9c102 driver from the mainline kernel, a recent gspca patch fixes
  this, adjust libv4l to match (and make it work properly with the sn9c102
  driver).

libv4l-0.4.1
------------
* When the driver supports read() and we are not converting let the driver
  handle read() instead of emulating it with mmap mode
* Fix errors and warnings when compiling with ICC (Gregor Jasny)
* Add support to libv4lconvert for rotating images 90 (for Pixart 7302 cams)
  or 180 (Philips SPC200NC / Philips SPC300NC) degrees
* Add support for Pixart custom JPEG format
* Hide non public symbols (Gregor Jasny)
* Fix and enable x86_64 asm jpeg decompress helper functions (Gregor Jasny)

libv4l-0.4.0
------------
* Be more relaxed in our checks for mixing read and mmap access, we were
  being more strict in this then certain kernel drivers (bttv) making xawtv
  unhappy
* With some drivers the buffers must be mapped before queuing, so when
  converting map the (real) buffers before calling the qbuf ioctl
* Add support for conversion to RGB24 (before we only supported BGR24) based
  on a patch by Jean-Francois Moine
* When the hardware supports a format natively prefer using the native
  version over converting from another supported format
* Various Makefile and pkgconfig file improvements by Gregor Jasny (Debian)
* Drop the appl-patches dir, all application patches are now available and
  tracked here: http://linuxtv.org/v4lwiki/index.php/Libv4l_Progress


libv4l-0.3.9
------------
* Not only see /dev/video* but also /dev/v4l/* as video devices
  (only affects libv4l1 and the wrappers) patch from Brandon Philips
* Silence the creation of the .pc files in the Makefiles (Brandon Philips)
* Part of the copyright headers refered GPL instead of LGPL due to a copy
  and paste error (Brandon Philips)


libv4l-0.3.8
------------
* work around wrong REQUEST_BUFFERS ioctl return code from certain drivers
* add pkg-config (.pc) files for easier detection if libv4l is available
* check capabilities for streaming, if the driver cannot do streaming don't
  insert ourselves between the application and the driver
* intercept get capabilites and report read capability (which we always offer)
* query buffer: indicate the mapping state of our (fake) buffer in the flags


libv4l-0.3.7
------------
* Add spca505/6 and spca508 cam specific formats (YUYV per line variations)


libv4l-0.3.6
------------
* Add missing COPYING.LIB file


libv4l-0.3.5
------------
* Make JPEG decoding more robust


libv4l-0.3.4 (the brownpaperbag release)
----------------------------------------
* The mmap64 support in 0.3.3, has caused a bug in libv4l1 when running on
  32 bit systems (who uses those now a days?), this bug caused v4l1
  compatibility to not work at all, this release fixes this
* Some apps (xawtv, kopete) use an ioctl wrapper internally for various
  reasons. This wrappers request argument is an int, but the real ioctl's
  request argument is an unsigned long. Passing the VIDIOC_xxx defines through
  to the wrapper, and then to the real ioctl, causes the request to get sign
  extended on 64 bit args. The kernel seems to ignore the upper 32 bits,
  causing the sign extension to not make a difference. libv4l now also
  ignores the upper 32 bits of the libv4lx_ioctl request argument on 64 bit
  archs
* Add a bugfix patch for kopete in the appl-patches dir, currently it assumes
  that it got the width and height it asked for when doing a S_FMT, which is a
  wrong assumption


libv4l-0.3.3
------------
* Add open64 and mmap64 wrappers to the LD_PRELOAD wrapper libs, so that
  they also work for applications compiled with FILE_OFFSET_BITS=64, this
  fixes using them with v4l-info
* While looking at xawtv in general, found a few bugs in xawtv itself, added
  a patch to fix those to the appl-patches dir
* Talking about the appl-patches dir, restore that as it accidentally got
  dropped from 0.3.2
* Be more verbose in various places when it comes to logging (esp errors)
* Change v4lconvert_enum_fmt code a bit, so that it is easier to add more
  supported destination formats to libv4lconvert
* Don't return -EINVAL from try_fmt when we cannot convert because the cam
  doesn't have any formats we know. Instead just return as format whatever the
  cam returns from try_fmt, this new behavior is compliant with the v4l2
  api as documented

libv4l-0.3.2
------------
* Add support for converting from sn9c10x compressed data
* Add support for converting from pac207 compressed data
* Add "make install" Makefile target

libv4l-0.3.1
------------
* Only serialize V4L2_BUF_TYPE_VIDEO_CAPTURE type ioctls
* Do not return an uninitialized variable as result code for GPICT
  (fixes vlc, but see below)
* Add an apps-patches directory which includes:
  * vlc-0.8.6-libv4l1.patch, modify vlc's v4l1 plugin to directly call into
    libv4l1, in the end we want all apps todo this as its better then
    LD_PRELOAD tricks, but for vlc this is needed as vlc's plugin system
    causes LD_PRELOAD to not work on symbols in the plugins
  * camorama-0.19-fixes.patch, small bugfixes to camorama's v4l1 support,
    this patch only fixes _real_ bugs in camorama and does not change it to
    work with v4l1compat. Although it does work better with these bugs fixed
    :) With this patch and LD_PRELOAD=<path>/v4l1compat.so it works
    flawless.


libv4l-0.3
----------
* add extern "C" magic to public header files for c++ usage (Gregor Jasny)
* Make libv4l1 and libv4l2 multithread use safe, see README.multi-threading
* Add v4lx_dup() calls (and intercept dup() from the wrappers) this fixes
  use with gstreamer's v4l2 plugin (tested with cheese)
* Hopefully definitely fix compile errors on systems with a broken videodev2.h

libv4l-0.2
----------
*** API change ***
* Change v4lconvert api so that the v4lconvert struct always gets allocated
  by the library, this to make it opaque, so that we can avoid future API
  and ABI changes
* Add support for yuv420 -> bgr24 conversion
* When converting from v4l2 pixelformat to v4l12 palette return
  VIDEO_PALETTE_YUV420P instead of VIDEO_PALETTE_YUV420 for
  V4L2_PIX_FMT_YUV420 as that is what most apps seem to expect
* override kernel v4l1 compat min / max size with our own more accurate values
* fix v4l1 munmap bug where it didn't recognise the buffer being unmapped was
  our fake buffer (fixes gstreamer v4l1 support, checked with cheese)
* add support for reporting the emulated pixelformats with ENUM_FMT, this
  defaults to off, and can be activated by passing a flag to enable it to
  v4l2_fd_open. This gets enabled by default the wrappers.
* v4l2: mmap the real device buffers before doing conversion when DQBUF gets
  called before the application has called mmap (avoid crash).


libv4l-0.1
----------
* major shuffle / rewrite now split into libv4l1, libv4l2, libv4lconvert
  and 2 wrappers for binary compatibility
* rewritten LGPL bayer decoding
* many many other changes and fixes


v4l1-compat-0.6 (V4L2 apps stay working)
----------------------------------------
* Do not go into emulation mode of rgb24 immediately, but only after a
  GPICT ioctl which has not been preceded by a SPICT ioctl, AKA do not get
  in the way of V4L2 read calls by doing conversion on them
* Do not get in the way of mmap calls made by V4L2 applications
* Fix swapping of red and blue in bayer -> bgr24 decode routine
* Remember the v4l1 palette asked for with SPICT and return that, as
  otherwise we loose information when going v4l1 -> v4l2 -> v4l1, for example
  YUV420P becomes YUV420, which are separate in v4l1.


v4l1-compat-0.5 (perfect camorama)
----------------------------------
* Allow changing of format after the buffers have been mapped, by tearing
  down the entire house, changing the fundament and then rebuilding it.
  Now changing the capture resolution in camorama works!
* Fix jpeg decoding error reporting
* Allow jpeg's with a height which is a multiple of 8 (was 16)
* Remove a number of pretty new VIDIOCXXX -> string mappings from log.c,
  fixing compiling with somewhat older kernels


v4l1-compat 0.4
---------------
* Do not even try to change the format in v4l1_compat_set_format(), unless
  _really_ necessary.
* Cleanup ambigious use of src_format (no functional changes)
* Drop the mmap hack for zerocopy access under certain conditions, one of them
  that the cam can deliver the requested format. Although avoiding the
  memcpy in this scenarios is a good thing todo, there were several issues
  with the 0.3 implementation of this, fixing all these means adding lots of
  special cases all over the code. So instead we just drop support and
  always do atleast a memcpy (or a conversion). If an application cannot
  live with the speed penalty this imposes it should be ported to v4l2.
* Now that we've gotten rid of the zerocopy mmap hack, we can safely allow
  mixing read and mmap based IO.
* Explictly include linux/ioctl.h, to fix compile with kernel headers where
  linux/videodev.h doesn't.


v4l1-compat 0.3
---------------
* Don't allow multiple opens, in theory our code can handle it, but not all
  v4l2 devices like it (ekiga does it and uvc doesn't like it).


v4l1-compat 0.2
---------------
* When mmap gets passed an fd of -1 (anonymous map) don't look for it in our
  list of managed fds, as we use -1 to mark unused entries (fixes ekiga
  crashing). Also check for an fd of -1 in the other calls we intercept.
* In close() start with removing the fd from our list of managed fds, this must
  be done first, because as soon as we've done the actual close syscall, the
  fd maybe returned by an open in another thread and we don't want to intercept
  calls to this new fd.
* Make unknown v4l1 palette types a normal level log messages instead of an
  error.
* When an applicaiton changes the width / height through the CMCAPTURE ioctl
  remember the new width and height.
* If the devices initial v4l2 pixformat has no corresponding v4l1 palette, try
  setting a format which does (and which we emulate when necessary) so that
  applicactions which just query the current format (GPICT) and then take
  whatever they get will work (partially fixes camorama)
* Implement our own SWIN instead of using kernel compat layer, for more
  flexibility and better error checking


v4l1-compat 0.1
---------------
* Initial public release.
